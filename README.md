# Linear Regression – From Scratch (Python)

This project implements a simple **linear regression model from scratch** using Python.
The goal is to understand the core idea behind linear regression without using any
machine learning libraries.

## Description

The model follows the linear equation:

y = a·x + b

- The slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`) are defined manually.
- Model predictions are computed explicitly using a loop.
- The dataset and model output are visualized using matplotlib.

This approach is intended for **educational purposes**, focusing on how linear regression
works internally rather than on library usage.

## Files

- `linear_regression.py`  
  Implements data definition, model computation, and visualization.

## Libraries Used

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output

- Scatter plot of the raw data
- Line plot showing the linear model prediction over the data

## Purpose

This example is part of a personal machine learning practice repository and serves as
a foundation for understanding more advanced regression techniques.
